Columbus Investments Inc. plans to run an internet café “Bella Vista Internet Café” in Auckland CBD which will primarily target tourists and students living around the CBD. The café will provide services like internet surfing, downloading, printing, scanning, and postal services.
They have leased a 100-meter square space at the CBD and have all infrastructure like computers, printers, scanners, modems, switches, etc purchased. The expected cost of the entire project is NZD 350,000.
This project requires an automated billing system that records the duration of use, data uploaded/ downloaded, and printing done during the period and calculates the amount payable at the end of use. This software needs to be installed and running on each machine and monitored by software installed on their server.
